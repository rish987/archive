\begin{proposition}
  We have \actcindpropfull
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  Because $\actcindpre$ is defined,
  we have that 
  $$\PSTT(\actcindprelist) > 0,$$ 
  implying that
  $$\PSTT(\actcindpostlist) > 0.$$
  Therefore,
  $\actcindpost$ is also defined.
  Suppose 
  $\AV_\TT = \AA \in \A$
  and
  $\SV_\TT = \SS \in \S$.
  \lngdefinition{archives/topic/rl_theory/definition/pact}{It follows by definition} that 
  $$\pactdef,$$
  so \lngdefinition{archives/topic/rl_theory/definition/pactdef}{there are two cases} to consider:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Case 1: $\pactdefp = 1$.

      \lnproof{ponecind}{It follows more generally} that,
      for any random variables 
      \listrv
      we have
      $$\pcindprop1.$$

    \item Case 2: $\pactdefp = 0$.

      \lnproof{pzerocind}{It follows more generally} that,
      for any random variables 
      \listrv
      we have
      $$\pcindprop0.$$
  \end{itemize}
\end{proof}
