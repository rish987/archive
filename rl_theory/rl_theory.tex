  Consider the following ``\brd'':\\
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[board]
      \board{
        \tileloop{\actions{\row}{\col}}
        \tilecoords{0}{0}\agent{}
      }
    \end{tikzpicture},
  \end{center}
  where there are a total of 9 ``\til{}s'' (\tikz[board, scale=0.1]{\tilecoords{0}{0}\tile{0}\tileidx{$\cdot$}}), 
  an ``\agt'' (\tikz[board, scale=0.7]{\tilecoords{0}{0}\agent{}}), and
  a set of ``\act{}s'' ($\rightarrow$) that the \agt\ can take at every \til.

  At every ``\stp'' in time, the agent is in one of the \til{}s,
  and must take one of the \act{}s. 

  At any \stp, if the \agt\ takes an \act\ in a \til, 
  it will be in a \til\ at the next \stp\ according to a ``\trd''
  (that only depends on the current \til\ and \act, not the current \stp).

  For example, the \agt\ could
  \begin{itemize}
    \def\tilesep{3.2}
    \def\tscale{0.6}
    \item take \act\ $\uparrow$ at \til\ $7$:
      \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}[board, scale=\tscale]
          \tilecoords{0}{1}
          \tileandidx{7}
          \tileup{draw=blue}
          \agent{}

          \tilecoords{0}{0}
          \tileandidx{4}

          \tilecoords{1}{1}
          \tileandidx{8}

          \tiletransition{7}{8}{below}{0.25}
          \tiletransition{7}{4}{left}{0.75}
        \end{tikzpicture},
      \end{center}
      and
    \item take \act\ $\rightarrow$ at \til\ $5$:
      \begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}[board, scale=\tscale]
          \tilecoords{1}{1}
          \tileandidx{5}
          \tileright{draw=blue}
          \agent{}

          \tilecoords{0}{1}
          \tileandidx{4}

          \tilecoords{2}{1}
          \tileandidx{6}

          \tilecoords{1}{0}
          \tileandidx{2}

          \tilecoords{1}{2}
          \tileandidx{8}

          \tiletransition{5}{6}{below}{0.75}
          \tiletransition{5}{4}{above}{0.05}
          \tiletransition{5}{2}{left}{0.10}
          \tiletransition{5}{8}{right}{0.10}
        \end{tikzpicture},
      \end{center}
  \end{itemize}
  showing the probability of 
  being in another \til\ at 
  the next \stp\ according to the \trd.

  However, this begs the question, 
  what \til\ is the \agt\ at initially (\stp\ 1)? 
  To decide this, there is also an \ind\ over the \til{}s.

  \newpage
  Now, let's make things a bit more interesting. 

  Let every \til\ also have a \rwd\ that 
  the \agt\ recieves from it, 
  leaving our \brd\ looking something like:

  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[board]
      \fullboard{
        \tileloop{\actions{\row}{\col}}
        \tilecoords{0}{0}\agent{}
      }
    \end{tikzpicture},
  \end{center}
  with the \rwd{}s 
  (\tikz[board, scale=0.5]{\tilecoords{0}{0}\tilerwdraw{$\cdot$}{(0,0)}}) shown.

  Also, let there be some fixed ``\lmt'' such that,
  when the current \stp\ reaches it, everything ends.

  Now, suppose you can ``program'' the \agt\ as follows: 
  for every \til\ and \stp, you can fix the \act\ that the \agt\ takes.
  For example, here's what you might program the \agt\ to do 
  at every \til\ for two different \stp{}s:
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[board]
      \fullboardact{1}{}
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \hspace{1cm}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[board]
      \fullboardact{2}{.}
    \end{tikzpicture}.
  \end{center}
  We'll call each such programming a ``\str''. 

  We know that the \agt\ starts in some \til\ according to the \ind.
  After this, we follow the \str, 
  transitioning \til{}s according to the \trd, recieving \rwd{}s 
  at every \til\ until
  we reach the \lmt. Let's refer to this process as a ``\run'', and
  the sum of the \rwd{}s over all a \run's \til{}s
  as the ``\trwd''.

  Because there is some \ind\ and \trd\ 
  that are fixed over \run{}s, 
  we know there must be 
  some \atrwd\ for every \str.

  Now, consider the following question: 
  what \str\ has the greatest \atrwd?
