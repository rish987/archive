  This ``reachability requirement'' is necessary
  because of the fact that
  $$\text{ 
  $
  \PSTT(\A_\TT = \STT_\TT(\SS') \mid \S_\TT = \SS')$ 
  is defined } 
  \iff 
  \PSTT(\S_{\TT} = \SS') > 0
  .$$%

  From the definition of conditional probability, we have
  $$ 
  \PSTT(\A_\TT = \STT_\TT(\SS') \mid \S_\TT = \SS')
  = 
  \frac
  {\PSTT(\A_\TT = \STT_\TT(\SS'), \S_\TT = \SS')}
  {\PSTT(\S_\TT = \SS')}.$$

  In one direction, we have that if $\PSTT(\S_\TT = \SS') > 0$, then 
  $ \PSTT(\A_\TT = \STT_\TT(\SS') \mid \S_\TT = \SS') $
  is also defined because the denominator in the equation above is nonzero.

  In the other direction, we have that if $\PSTT(\S_\TT = \SS') = 0$, then 
  $ \PSTT(\A_\TT = \STT_\TT(\SS') \mid \S_\TT = \SS') $
  is undefined because the denominator in the equation above zero.
