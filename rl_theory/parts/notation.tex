\begin{part}{Notation}
  To answer this question, let's establish some notation.

  Let's denote
  $$\text{$\S \defeq$ the set of \til{}s},$$
  and 
  $$\text{$\A \defeq$ the set of \act{}s.}$$
  Assume that $\S$ and $\A$ are finite.
  Denote
  $$\text{$\RW : \S \rightarrow \R \defeq$ mapping from \til{}s to \rwd{}s.}$$

  Denote
  $$\text{$\T \defeq$ the \lmt, where $\T \ge 1$},$$
  $$\text{$\STT = \left(\edots\STT{1}{\T}\right) \defeq$ an arbitrary \str, 
  where each ``\stpstr'' \lnnote{fnnot}{$\fnnot{\STT_\TT}{\S}{\A}$}},$$
  and
  $$\text{$\ST \defeq$ the set of all \strs\ $\pi$}.$$
  Note that \lnproof{npol}{$|\ST| = \T \times |\S| \times |\A|$}.

  Now, suppose the \agt\ is following some \str\ $\STT$.
  For all $1 \le \TT \le \T$,
  denote
  $$\text{$\S_\TT \defeq$ random variable for the \til\ at \stp\ $\TT$},$$
  and
  $$\text{$\A_\TT \defeq$ random variable for the \act\ at \stp\ $\TT$},$$
  whose distributions are dependent on $\STT$.

  Let $\PSTT(\cdot)$ and $\ESTT(\cdot)$ denote the probability of an event
  and the expectation of a quantity
  when the \agt\ follows $\STT$.
  For all $\SS \in \S$, we know that
  $$\PSTT(\S_1 = \SS)$$
  is defined by the \ind, and
  for all $\SS, \SS' \in \S$, $2 \le \TT \le \T$ 
  \lnnote{rchreq}{such that $\PSTT(\S_{\TT - 1} = \SS') > 0$},
  $$\PSTT(\S_\TT = \SS \mid \A_\TTM = \STT_\TTM(\SS'), \S_\TTM = \SS')$$
  is defined by the \trd, where 
  $\S_\TT$ is independent of all previous \til{}s and \act{}s given $\A_\TTM$ and $\S_\TTM$.
  Notationally, for all $2 \le \TT \le \T$,
  %$$ \left( \S_\TT \independent \A_{\TT - 2}, \S_{\TT - 2}, \ldots, \A_{1}, \S_{1} \right)\mid \A_\TTM, \S_\TTM.$$
  $$ 
  \PSTT\left( \S_\TT \mid \A_{\TTM}, \S_{\TTM}, \ldots, \A_{1}, \S_{1} \right)
  = 
  \PSTT\left( \S_\TT \mid \A_{\TTM}, \S_{\TTM}\right)
  $$
  (here we use \lnnote{implasn}{implied assignment}).
  Because we follow a fixed \str, we know that
  $$\PSTT(\A_\TT = \STT_\TT(\SS') \mid \S_\TT = \SS') = 1$$
  for all
  $1 \le \TT \le \T - 1$.

  We can now write the \trwd\ as
  $$\sum_{\TT = 1}^\T \RW(\S_\TT)$$
  and the \atrwd\ as
  $$\ESTT\left[\sum_{\TT = 1}^\T \RW(\S_\TT)\right].$$
