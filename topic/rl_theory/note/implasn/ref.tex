  Consider the random variable $\XV$ supported on $\X$. 
  When we write $$\Pr{\XV = \XX}$$
  for some $\XX \in \X,$
  we associate the random variable $\XV$ with the assignment $\XX$.

  We may later, for brevity, write this same quantity
  as $$\Pr{\XX}.$$
  It should always be clear from the context what random variable is being assigned.
  This is referred to as ``implied assignment.''

  This applies more generally to multiple random variables,
  for every combination of assignments.
