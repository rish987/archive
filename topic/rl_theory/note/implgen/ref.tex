  \ntodo{out of date; to be reworded and put under {\tt /T/prob}.}

  Consider the random variable $\XV$ supported on $\X$. 
  When we write $\XV$ by itself in a probability equation,
  we mean to say that 
  \ctext{the equation applies when $\XV$ is replaced with $\XV = \XX$
  for all $\XX \in \X$.}
  This applies more generally to multiple random variables, 
  for every combination of assignments.
