\begin{definition}
  Recall from the definition of conditional probability that,
  for random variables 
  \ctext{$\XV$ supported on $\X$ and
  $\YV$ supported on $\Y$,}
  we have for all $\XX \in \X$, $\YY \in \Y$ such that $\P(\YV = \YY) > 0$:
  $$\P(\XV = \XX \mid \YV = \YY) \defeq \frac{\P(\XV = \XX, \YV = \YY)}{\P(\YV = \YY)},$$%
  with $\P(\XV = \XX \mid \YV = \YY)$ undefined if $\P(\YV = \YY) = 0$.
\end{definition}
