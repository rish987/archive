\begin{definition}
  Recall from the definition of conditional probability that,
  for random variables 
  \ctext{$\XV$ supported on $\X$ and
  $\YV$ supported on $\Y$,}
  we have for all $\XX \in \X$, $\YY \in \Y$ such that $\Pr{\YV = \YY} > 0$:
  $$\Pr{\XV = \XX \mid \YV = \YY} \defeq \frac{\Pr{\XV = \XX, \YV = \YY}}{\Pr{\YV = \YY}},$$%
  with $\Pr{\XV = \XX \mid \YV = \YY}$ undefined if $\Pr{\YV = \YY} = 0$.
\end{definition}
