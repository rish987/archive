  denote a \jasn\ (\asn\ for short) [or, \masn\ (in simple English, a list of equalities that doesn't cover the entire \spt\ is a \masn)].

  If a \jasn\ or \masn\ was previously specified, we may later drop ``$\XV =$'', for ``implied assignment'':
  $$\JASN{\XX}.$$
  If a \jasn\ or \masn\ was never specified, we assume an arbitrary $\pin\XX\X$ for ``implied generality'':
  $$\JASN{\XV}.$$
