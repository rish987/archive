  \ctext{$\XV \defeq$ an arbitrary \var\ with domain $\X$,}
  where we use $\XX$ to denote an element of $\X$.

  We implicitly maintain that 
  anything we describe using $\XV$ and $\X$
  also applies when these are replaced with two or more
  \var{}s/\dmn{}s: $\XV$/$\X$, \ldots, $\XV'$/$\X'$. 
  Notational expansions are described where applicable.

  Define 
  $\YV, \Y, \YY$,
  and
  $\ZV, \Z, \ZZ$
  similarly.
