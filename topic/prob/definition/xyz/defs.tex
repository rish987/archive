  \ctext{$\XV \defeq$ an arbitrary \var\ with domain $\X$.}

  We implicitly maintain that 
  anything we describe using $\XV$ and $\X$
  also applies when these are replaced with one or more
  \var{}s/\dmn{}s: $\XV$/$\X$, \ldots, $\XV'$/$\X'$. 
  Notational expansions are described where applicable.

  Define 
  $\YV, \Y$
  and
  $\ZV, \Z$
  similarly.

  Define 
  $\QV, \Q$ similarly, but instead implicitly maintain that
  anything we describe using $\QV$ and $\Q$
  also applies when these are replaced with {\em zero} or more
  \var{}s/\dmn{}s.
