\begin{proposition}
  \nrp 1
  We have that \mpproblimdefprop.%
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  \nrp 2
  We have that, for all $\DDD \in \DD$,
    $$ \MPr{\XV = \XX} \relrg = {\mreflng{archive/topic/prob/definition/mprob}} 10pt
                    \MPRSQ{\DDD}{\XV = \XX}
                    \relr {\ne} {\mreflng{archive/topic/prob/proof/sqpmproblimdef}}
                    \undef.$$%
\end{proof}
