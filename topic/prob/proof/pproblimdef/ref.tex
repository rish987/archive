\begin{proposition}
  We have that \pproblimdefprop.%
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  We have that, for all $\DDD \in \DD$,
    $$ \Pr{\XV = \XX} \relrg = {\mreflng{definition}{archive/topic/prob/definition/prob}} 10pt
                    \PRSQ{\DDD}{\XV = \XX}
                    \relr {\ne} {\mreflng{proof}{archive/topic/prob/proof/problimdef}}
                    \undef.$$%
\end{proof}
